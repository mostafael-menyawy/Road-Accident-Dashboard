# Road Accident Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains an Excel dashboard that visualizes various trends and insights related to road accidents.
The dashboard is designed to help understand factors contributing to road accidents and strategize for better road safety measures.

## Project Overview
The Road Accident Dashboard project aims to analyze road accident data to uncover key trends and insights. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of accident patterns, contributing factors, and potential areas for improving road safety.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data analysis, visualization, and dashboard creation.
- 
## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involved several steps to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis:
1. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data were either filled with appropriate values (e.g., mean, median) or removed if deemed unnecessary.
2. **Data Formatting**: Ensured all data was in the correct format (e.g., dates, numeric values).
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data:
1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for key variables.
2. **Visual Analysis**: Created various charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns, such as:
   - **Severity of Casualties**: Analysis of casualty severity over time.
   - **Road Type Breakdown**: Breakdown of accidents by different road types.
   - **Surface Conditions**: Examination of how different surface conditions affect accident rates.
   - **Vehicle Types**: Insights into the types of vehicles involved in accidents.
   - **Lighting Conditions**: Analysis of accidents under various lighting conditions.
   - **Comparative Analysis**: Comparison of accident data between the years 2021 and 2022.

## Results
The analysis provided several key insights:
- **Severity of Casualties**: Highlighted trends in the severity of casualties over the analyzed period.
- **Road Type Breakdown**: Identified which road types had higher accident frequencies.
- **Surface Conditions**: Showed the impact of different surface conditions on accident rates.
- **Vehicle Types**: Revealed which types of vehicles were most commonly involved in accidents.
- **Lighting Conditions**: Illustrated the effect of lighting conditions on accident occurrences.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Demonstrated changes in accident patterns between 2021 and 2022.
